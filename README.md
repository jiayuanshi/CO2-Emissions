# CO2-Emissions
Carbon dioxide emissions are the primary driver of global climate change. Itâ€™s widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to urgently reduce emissions. But, how this responsibility is shared between regions, countries, and individuals has been an endless point of contention in international discussions.

In this project, we are going to explore around CO2 emissions and temperature changes to the environment over time, investigate whether there's any relationship between GDP per capital and CO2 eimissions, and summarize the statistics of emissions from different sources by continent. The deliverable will be generated with Panel package and hvplot from pandas. Connecting pipeline with widgets created for the purpose of controling variants will be a crutial sections of the project. 

Here's a screenshot of the final dashboard! Feel free to play around with the dashboard after walking through the notebooka and executing "panel serve CO2_dashboard.ipynb" in terminal :)
